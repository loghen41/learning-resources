Conditionals
----------------------

## What are conditionals?
A language supporst conditionals when it provides syntax to accomplish conditional logic. 

As in, the ability to have different blocks of code be executed depending on specific conditions. 

For example: 
  - We have two vehicles. 
  - One is a truck. 
  - The other is a sedan. 
  - If we are building automotive software to support both platforms, and we want specific logic for trucks. We would use a conditional.

## Common Conditionals
The most common conditionals include:
- if, else if, else
- switch, case, break
- try, catch, finally

## Lesson structure
Each lesson will show the process of
- Information about the most common conditionals
    - if, else if, else
    - switch, case, default


## Conditionals in Depth
Conditionals are fairly simple as a concept. If you desire additional information, refer to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_(computer_programming)).

## In summary
Conditional syntax was established in order to:
- Support conditional logic for code flows
- There are multiple types of conditional logic, the syntax and types supported will vary from language to language
