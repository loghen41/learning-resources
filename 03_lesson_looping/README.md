Looping
----------------------

## What is Looping?
A language supports Looping when it provides syntax to complete a section of code repeatedly

As in, A section of code will be repeatedly run based on the looping syntax

For example: 
  - We have a list of numbers
  - We want to add the list of numbers together into a single number
  - We go through the list of numbers and add them together into a single value

## Common Conditionals
The most common loops include:
- for 
- for ... in
- while


## Lesson structure
Each lesson will show the process of
- Information about the most common conditionals
  - for 
  - for ... in


## Conditionals in Depth
Conditionals are fairly simple as a concept. If you desire additional information, refer to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_loop).

## In summary
Looping syntax was established in order to:
- Support repeated logic in blocks of code
- There are multiple types of looping logic, the syntax and types supported will vary from language to language
