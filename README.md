`Learning Processes and Resources`

# What does this repo accomplish
Learning Resources is an exercise based repo for beginner to intermediate learners.
It is designed to teach fundemental concepts of computer science and programming.
It also can be used as an exercise tool for individuals changing between languages.

The exercises are based on teaching computational logic and reasoning while also teaching syntax.
As such, each section will not be syntax driven only, it's designed to teach you the core concepts of programming as you progress through the course.
Recommendations are to fork the repo to your own github user, and then push your solutions to your own git repo as you finish them.
